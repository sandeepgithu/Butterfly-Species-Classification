Key Aspects of the Code:
CNN Architecture:

Input Layer:
The network starts with an input layer that accepts images of shape (None, 3, 224, 224), where None represents the batch size, 3 represents the color channels (RGB), and 224x224 is the resolution of the input images.
Convolutional Layers with Batch Normalization:

The CNN consists of several convolutional layers, each followed by batch normalization to stabilize and accelerate training. The convolution layers are initialized using Glorot Uniform and use the ReLU activation function.
The network applies two convolution layers sequentially, followed by a max-pooling layer to reduce the spatial dimensions.
The convolution layers have a kernel size of 3x3 and use padding to maintain the same spatial dimensions before pooling.
Max Pooling:

After every two convolution layers, a max-pooling layer with a 2x2 pool size is applied to down-sample the feature maps.
Fully Connected Layers (Affine Layers):

Two fully connected (dense) layers are used in this architecture, each followed by dropout for regularization to prevent overfitting. The dropout rate is set to 0.5, and the layers are initialized using Glorot Uniform with ReLU activation.
Output Layer (Scores):

The final layer is a fully connected layer with a softmax activation function. It computes the class probabilities for each input image. The number of classes (num_classes) is set to 10, which represents the 10 different butterfly species the model is trained to classify.
Function Definition:
create_cnn: This function defines the CNN model architecture and returns the network. The function takes the following parameters:
input_shape: Shape of the input image (default is (None, 3, 224, 224)).
num_filters: List of filter sizes for the convolutional layers.
filter_size: Size of the convolutional kernel (default is 3).
hidden_dims: List of dimensions for the fully connected (dense) layers.
num_classes: The number of output classes (default is 10).
